        <p id="fourthP"> My Story</p>
        <p id="fifthP"> Hello my name is Rachel Solomon and I am 10 years old. I have a brother named Ethan and he is 4 years old. My birthday is may 26 2010. When I have free time I would like to go swimming or bake. Since there is corona I won't be able to do swimming so I do baking. My favorite color is aqua and my favorite food if pizza, burger, pasta, and chicken. I like to travel to places that are hot like Florida, Miami Orlando, India, Ohio and many more. I always like to bake for my family or friends. My favorite holiday is Christmas, Easter, Birthdays, Valentines Day, and July 4th. </p>
